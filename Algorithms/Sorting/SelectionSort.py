# Selection Sort Algorithm

# Best case    : 0(n^2)
# Average case : 0(n^2)
# Worst case   : 0(n^2)
# Space complexity : 0(1)
#
# Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each
# iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list. It repeats this process until
# all the elements are sorted.
