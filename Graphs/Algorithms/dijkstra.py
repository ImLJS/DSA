# Dijkstra algorithm implementation

# It is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
# The algorithm exists in many variants; Dijkstra's original variant found the shortest path between two nodes,
# but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source
# to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

# The algorithm is often used in routing and as a subroutine in other graph algorithms.

# Time complexity: O(V^2) where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
# Space complexity: O(V) where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
