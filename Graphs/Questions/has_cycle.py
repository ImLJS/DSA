# has cycle
#
# Write a function, has_cycle, that takes in an object representing the adjacency list
# of a directed graph. The function should return a boolean indicating whether the
# graph contains a cycle.

# Example:

# has_cycle({
#   "a": ["b"],
#   "b": ["c"],
#   "c": ["a"],
# }) # -> True

# has_cycle({
#   "a": ["b", "c"],
#   "b": ["c"],
#   "c": ["d"],
#   "d": [],
# }) # -> False
