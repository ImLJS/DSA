# Prims Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree

# Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.
# This algorithm maintains a set of vertices that have been visited and a set of vertices that have not been visited.
# The algorithm starts with an arbitrary vertex and adds the vertex with the smallest edge weight to the visited set.
# The algorithm continues to add the vertex with the smallest edge weight to the visited set until all vertices have been visited.
# The algorithm uses a min heap to keep track of the vertices that have not been visited and the edge weights between the visited and unvisited vertices.
# The algorithm returns the total weight of the minimum spanning tree.

# Time Complexity: O(E log V)
# Space Complexity: O(V)
